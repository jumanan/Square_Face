This project was submitted as a final project in the course nand to tetris (2007) during my bachelor degree at the Hebrew University. The course involved constructing a hardware platform for a simple modern computer, and then we built higher level programming for this hardware starting from an assembler and ending with a compiler for a high level object oriented programming language (jack). The project is a game similar to PAC-MAN implemented in this high level langauge. The project was done with Majeed Kassis.
